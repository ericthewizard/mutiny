## Origin

mutiny is a hard-fork of the `matplotlib` version of `pyplot`, a Python library for plotting and analyzing data in space physics. The space physics code has been removed, and the primary emphasis of this project is to make creating powerful time series plots simple, in a variety of domains (physics, finance, analytics, and everywhere else time series plots are used).
